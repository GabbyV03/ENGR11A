                For the second part of the project, we were tasked with printing a stress test. I chose to print a Low-Poly Yoshi, hoping 
                that the large nose lacking support would be a good overhang test for the printer. I downloaded the stl file from Thingiverse 
                and imported it into Prusa Slicer. It was at this part that I learned more about the differnces between 3mf and stl files. 
                3mf files are the files that contain more detailed information regarding the print, such as color, textures, materials, and other 
                metadata. On the otherhand, stl files are the files that contain the 3D model geometry, but not the detailed information that 3mf 
                files have. I changed the settings to 0.2mm quality, 20% infill. The print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I 
                would consider stress points.

                During the first few minutes of printing, I focused on adherance issues. I learned that the first layer is the most important 
                layer of the print and often where 80-90% of issues occur (this is especially true when I would 3D print in High School), 
                as it is the layer that adheres to the print bed. If the first layer is not adhering properly, the print will fail. I learned 
                how to adjust the bed level, clean the bed, and use glue stick to help with adherence. It started off well, but the print had some 
                geometrical design flaws that caused the filament to not adhere properly at some points. It fixed itself after a few layers and it could start 
                building up the walls and infill, but in the future I would want to fix the design flaws before printing as well as checking the bed level 
                and cleaning the bed before printing.

                This was the most critical part of the print. The overhang of the nose was a critical point in the print as I thought it would start stringing down 
                and possibly ruin the print. I learned that overhangs are areas of the print that are not fully supported by the layer below it or by some sort of support that
                can be taken off after the print is done. It started off going the way I expected-with some hanging layers, but as the print went on, the layers became more stable and eventually the "failure" that can be 
                seen in the photo is all that really "messed up" the print.

                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider stress points, such as the overhang under the nose and the adherence issues. I think this speaks to
                the limitations of the 3D printer and the design of the print. The printer relies on the design to have a good base fill in and support structure in order to print properly. I think that in the future, I would want 
                to fix the design flaws. The overhang can be prevented with a support structure, and only then would I consider the print to be a total success.
