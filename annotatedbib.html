                During our initial design research, we found that many sources and studies done on phone addiction usually just say it is a problem but don't give any viable open source solutions that aren't just software with easy override or a general purpose lockbox.

Distinguishing Different Types of Mobile Phone Addiction: Development and Validation of the Mobile Phone Addiction Type Scale (MPATS) in Adolescents and Young Adults. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19(5), Article 5. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052593
                This source outlines research into different types of mobile phone addiction, and the development of a Mobile Phone Addiction Type Scale (MPATS) for adolescents and young adults. The study concludes that the MPATS has good construct validity, and is a suitable tool in measuring multiple types of mobile phone addiction in adolescents. This article allows for further specification when looking at mobile phone addiction, and when developing a solution, will aid in discovering which specific type of mobile phone addiction is being seen. The article does not further analyze the results of their tests, but provides the symptoms that will allow for the user to further understand mobile phone addiction.

                Choliz, M. (2012). Mobile-phone addiction in adolescence: The Test of Mobile Phone Dependence (TMD). Prog Health Sci, 2, 33–44.
This source presents an instrument, the Test of Mobile Phone Dependence (TMD), constructed to determine dependence on mobile devices in adolescents. It outlines the development of this instrument, the results of administering it, and an analysis of those results. It finds that this instrument will likely be useful in researching and treating mobile phone addiction. This relates directly to our topic because understanding the symptoms and characterizations of mobile phone addiction is an important step in creating a solution. The source clearly recognizes what it accomplishes, and addresses its weaknesses in not further analyzing the results, which is important to not cause assumptions and interpretations that the study does not actually address. This source provides important base knowledge in relation to the other sources, as it creates a framework with which to view the effects of mobile phone addiction and ability to treat it.

This source studies what psychological and physiological effects are present when practicing self-control with mobile phones. It found that when given the assignment to either sit without a phone or sit with a phone and not use it, those without a phone present self-reported more concentration difficulties than those who had a phone present. This concluded in the findings that people find it more difficult to concentrate when there is no phone present, as opposed to either being on the phone or having one present but resisting use. This is useful because when designing a product that attempts to combat mobile phone addiction, it is of utmost importance to understand what psychological effects are taking place when having a phone present or not. This source leads to the conclusion that the product should not remove the phone entirely from the situation, as that may lead to reduced concentration ability, which is often the primary reason to not be on one’s phone.

                This source analyses the presentation of young adults having attachment issues with their phones, and demonstrates the loss of productivity and development of chronic issues such as depression, loneliness, and lack of social behavior. It uses surveys and group analyses to come to its conclusions, as well as pulling from a range of other established sources. It also notes many of the primary reasons these situations come about, including a range from the constant urge to have new experiences to seeking validation from online platforms. It further goes on to suggest an array of treatment options that could aid in the development of our product. This source is useful as it provides important information on not only the impacts of phone addiction, but the causes. Knowing why these things happen is an important step that will guide our creation process.

                This source explores reasons that the brain works in the way that it does, specifically in regards to distraction and other focus-related tendencies. It uses the SCARF model to represent important things to the brain, being status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, and fairness. It explains that these are the areas the limbic system has evolved to defend, and used this model to design strategies that don’t stimulate these defense systems. Rock found that visualization is an important part of information management. This source provides interesting information that could be useful in helping create a tool to reduce distractedness from phones.

This source focuses on a specific group, being undergraduate medical students in India. They used the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) to assess the risk of smartphone addiction. The results of the study were finding that 83.2% of students used their phone for more than 4 hours a day, with over 75% using phones in class and over half having their phones nearby when sleeping. It also found that many suffered from eye-strain, blurred vision, and numbness or tingling in their palms. This source is useful as it not only provides statistics on the number of people suffering, but also the physical ailments that come with this problem. The physical problems that come with mobile phone addiction have not been explored greatly in other sources, so although it requires more corroboration, it provides important new information for our product.

                This source aims to find the relationship between values taught in school and mobile phone addiction. The study consists of students in primary and secondary education. The methodology that was used was a combination of 4 different questionnaires related to the subject matter, and the creation of an 86-item instrument for use in the study. Based on the study, they concluded that the greater formation of values in school, the less mobile addiction. Specifically in regards to social values like inclusion, solidarity, and justice, the correlation between instilling these values and reducing mobile phone addiction was very strong. This study is very useful in thinking about a different way to address our problem, which is at a much more foundational level. When addressing problems with mobile phone addiction, we have solely focused on it being at an individual level, but this source provides insight into the importance of instilling other values earlier, which likely would reduce the overall problem.
