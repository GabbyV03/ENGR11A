                Liu, Q.-Q., Xu, X.-P., Yang, X.-J., Xiong, J., & Hu, Y.-T. (2022). Distinguishing Different Types of Mobile Phone Addiction: Development and Validation of the Mobile Phone Addiction Type Scale (MPATS) in Adolescents and Young Adults. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19(5), Article 5. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052593
                This source outlines research into different types of mobile phone addiction, and the development of a Mobile Phone Addiction Type Scale (MPATS) for adolescents and young adults. The study concludes that the MPATS has good construct validity, and is a suitable tool in measuring multiple types of mobile phone addiction in adolescents. This article allows for further specification when looking at mobile phone addiction, and when developing a solution, will aid in discovering which specific type of mobile phone addiction is being seen. The article does not further analyze the results of their tests, but provides the symptoms that will allow for the user to further understand mobile phone addiction.

                The Gosman Gym elevator is a great example of a design for assistance. It helps people with mobility issues get to the 
                floor they need to get to and it's also spacious so it can fit a lot of people. It also helps for carrying large gym 
                equipment up and down the floors.

                My group found that the tiered display stands in the campus store are a great example of design for aging. The stands at 
                different heights allows for people of all ages to see the products on display. The stands are also on wheels so they can be 
                moved around easily.

               The shade/light filters above the childrens playarea is a great example of design for young children. The shade protects the 
               children from the sun since they spend so much time outside. It is important to have adequate shade in childrens playgrounds 
               which is rare to see in other playgrounds.

                This ramp was recently installed near the front of campus to help people with mobility issues get up the hill. It used to be 
                just a regular hill with some worn down patches or flat areas for bikers but this way it made it accessible to more wheeled mobile gear.

                Upon entering the SCC, there is an info booth but it was obstructed by a large display of balloons. This is an example of design with a barrier, 
                despite not intentional the placement of the balloons in the design of the event they were for is a physical barrier to the info booth.

                Next to the SCC, there are stairs that lead to the lower level of the building. There is no sign that says where the stairs lead to or anything 
                preventing someone from going down there. There is a lack of information for anyone who is unfamiliar with the building or isn't explicitly told 
                to use those stairs/rooms.

                Initially I thought the emergency buttons were an example of design for aging but upon further inspection, the buttons are not labeled with who or 
                what they call or do. Buttons such as this are also broken so despite being made for help, they are instead an absence of help.

                Majority of the freshman dorms are made of brick and have a very old look to them. This is an example of design for historical specificity. The 
                architects wanted all the buildings to look the same especially during a time when riots were common, thus many of the buildings are riot proof.

                The solor panels oon top of the stop signs are a great example of design for environmental sustainability. The solar panels power the stop signs 
                lights at night so that drivers can easily see them. This is a great way to save energy and reduce the carbon footprint of the campus while also 
                making it safer, especially at a busy and dangerous intersection.
