            <h2>Part 1: Tinkercad Remix</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameBoySketch.jpg" alt="Gameboy sketch">
            <p>
                This first part involved finding a 3D model on Thingiverse and remixing it in Tinkercad. I chose to remix a Gameboy lightbox 
                model that I found into an actual box rather than just a translucent plate. A lot of what I had to do was working with what I had in 
                the design and the limitations of Tinkercad to pretty much extend the edges of the panel to make it a box with curved corners-which is
                 where I spent a while as seen down below.

            <h2>Making the rounded corners...</h2>
            <img src="assets/SubtractingRoundedCorner.png" alt="Cutting away corners of gameboy design">
            <p>
                I struggled to find the most efficient and clean way to carve out the walls of the box to make them rounded and fit to the design such 
                that it would fit together and not just keep the corners squared. I learned that Tinkercad has a lot of limitations in terms of what you
                can do with the shapes and how you can manipulate them. 
            </p>

            <h2>Gameboy Design in Tinkercad</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameboyReadyToPrint_336x207.png" alt="Gameboy design in tinkercad">
            <p>
                This was the final design of the Gameboy lightbox that I made in Tinkercad. I was able to make the box and the lid fit together and 
                have the design of the Gameboy on the front. I learned that Tinkercad is a good starting point for beginners to learn how to design 
                3D models, but it has its limitations in terms of what you can do with the shapes and how you can manipulate them. The gameboy pattern 
                on the top of the box also looked good in the design, but the flaw would show later on in the print.

            <p>
                I put the stl into Prusa Slicer and set the settings to 0.2mm quality, 20% infill, and 0.2mm nozzle. I didn't need any supports since
                the way I formatted the print layout meant that it would form naturally from the bottom up.

            <p>
                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider failures, such as the gameboy 
                design on the front being extremely thin and the details not showing up properly. I initially thought that the design would be raised off 
                the top but it was actually just a flat "silhouette" without any backing to it, which I couldn't tell from the initial design download and 
                the way it was formatted in Tinkercad. It was also a bit too small for the box, so I would have to resize it in the future. I think this would
                also solve the issue of the design not showing up properly. At certain points, the filament was also quite spotty and thinner than it should have been.

            <h2>Part 2: Fusion Remix</h2>
            <img src="assets/PikminHolderSketch_336x448.jpg" alt="Pikmin holder sketch">
            <p>
                For the second part of the project, we were tasked with remixing a 3D model in Fusion 360. I chose to remix a pencil holder that I found on Thingiverse. 
                I wanted to make the Pikmin look more like the actual Pikmin act from the game, so I added a nose, eyes, and a mouth to the design. I also wanted to make the Pikmin 
                look like it was part of the tree stump.

            <h2>Pikmin Pencil Holder in Fusion</h2>
            <img src="assets/PikminHolderFront_336x209.png" alt="Pikmin holder in fusion">
            <p>
                In remixing the design I found my initial idea to be a bit too ambitious given the time constraints so I had to line up the individual designs of each pikmin design I could find with the base design of the tree. I also wanted 
                to make the Pikmin look like it was standing on a base, so I added a base to the design. I learned that Fusion 360 is a more advanced CAD software than Tinkercad, since it has more features and 
                tools that you can use to create more complex designs. I also learned that Fusion 360 has a steeper learning curve than Tinkercad, but it is worth it to learn.

            <img src="assets/PikminHolderSlicer_336x176.png" alt="pikmin holder in slicer">
            <p>
                I put the stl into Prusa Slicer and set the settings to 0.2mm quality, 20% infill, and 0.2mm nozzle. I initially thought that the design would need a lot of supports but in an effort to decrease the amount of filament used, I decided to not use any supports and simplified some parts of the design that the slicer was having trouble decoding

            <img src="assets/PikminHolderFinal_336x252.jpg" alt="Pikmin holder printed">
            <p>
                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider stress points, such as the stringing due to the complexity and thinness at certain parts and the adherence issues. If I had more time I would defintely go back and add proper supports and make some changes to the thin parts so that they can rely on the larger structures like some of them do in this design.
