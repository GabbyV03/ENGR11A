            <h2>Part 1: Tinkercad Remix</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameBoySketch.jpg" alt="Gameboy sketch">
            <p>
                This first part involved finding a 3D model on Thingiverse and remixing it in Tinkercad. I chose to remix a Gameboy lightbox 
                model that I found into an actual box rather than just a translucent plate. A lot of what I had to do was working with what I had in 
                the design and the limitations of Tinkercad to pretty much extend the edges of the panel to make it a box with curved corners-which is
                 where I spent a while as seen down below.

            <h2>Making the rounded corners...</h2>
            <img src="assets/SubtractingRoundedCorner.png" alt="Cutting away corners of gameboy design">
            <p>
                I struggled to find the most efficient and clean way to carve out the walls of the box to make them rounded and fit to the design such 
                that it would fit together and not just keep the corners squared. I learned that Tinkercad has a lot of limitations in terms of what you
                can do with the shapes and how you can manipulate them.

            <h2>Gameboy Design in Tinkercad</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameboyReadyToPrint.png" alt="Gameboy design in tinkercad">
            <p>
                This was the final design of the Gameboy lightbox that I made in Tinkercad. I was able to make the box and the lid fit together and 
                have the design of the Gameboy on the front. I learned that Tinkercad is a good starting point for beginners to learn how to design 
                3D models, but it has its limitations in terms of what you can do with the shapes and how you can manipulate them. The gameboy pattern 
                on the top of the box also looked good in the design, but the flaw would show later on in the print.

            <h2>Gameboy design in Prusa Slicer</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameBoySlicer.png" alt="Gameboy design in slicer">
            <p>
                I put the stl into Prusa Slicer and set the settings to 0.2mm quality, 20% infill, and 0.2mm nozzle. I didn't need any supports since
                the way I formatted the print layout meant that it would form naturally from the bottom up.

            <p>
                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider failures, such as the gameboy 
                design on the front being extremely thin and the details not showing up properly. I initially thought that the design would be raised off 
                the top but it was actually just a flat "silhouette" without any backing to it, which I couldn't tell from the initial design download and 
                the way it was formatted in Tinkercad. It was also a bit too small for the box, so I would have to resize it in the future. I think this would
                also solve the issue of the design not showing up properly. At certain points, the filament was also quite spotty and thinner than it should have been.

            <p>
                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider stress points, such as the overhang under the nose and the adherence issues. I think this speaks to
                the limitations of the 3D printer and the design of the print. The printer relies on the design to have a good base fill in and support structure in order to print properly. I think that in the future, I would want 
                to fix the design flaws. The overhang can be prevented with a support structure, and only then would I consider the print to be a total success.
