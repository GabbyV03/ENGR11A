            <h2>Part 1: Tinkercad Remix</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameBoySketch.jpg" alt="Gameboy sketch">
            <p>
                This first part involved finding a 3D model on Thingiverse and remixing it in Tinkercad. I chose to remix a Gameboy lightbox 
                model that I found into an actual box rather than just a translucent plate. A lot of what I had to do was working with what I had in 
                the design and the limitations of Tinkercad to pretty much extend the edges of the panel to make it a box with curved corners-which is
                 where I spent a while as seen down below.

            <h2>Making the rounded corners...</h2>
            <img src="assets/SubtractingRoundedCorner.png" alt="Cutting away corners of gameboy design">
            <p>
                I struggled to find the most efficient and clean way to carve out the walls of the box to make them rounded and fit to the design such 
                that it would fit together and not just keep the corners squared. I learned that Tinkercad has a lot of limitations in terms of what you
                can do with the shapes and how you can manipulate them.

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Adherence Issues</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameboyReadyToPrint.png" alt="Yoshi Base Pic">
            <p>
                During the first few minutes of printing, I focused on adherance issues. I learned that the first layer is the most important 
                layer of the print and often where 80-90% of issues occur (this is especially true when I would 3D print in High School), 
                as it is the layer that adheres to the print bed. If the first layer is not adhering properly, the print will fail. I learned 
                how to adjust the bed level, clean the bed, and use glue stick to help with adherence. It started off well, but the print had some 
                geometrical design flaws that caused the filament to not adhere properly at some points. It fixed itself after a few layers and it could start 
                building up the walls and infill, but in the future I would want to fix the design flaws before printing as well as checking the bed level 
                and cleaning the bed before printing.

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overhang</h2>
            <img src="assets/GameBoySlicer.png" alt="Yoshi Under Nose Pic">
            <p>
                This was the most critical part of the print. The overhang of the nose was a critical point in the print as I thought it would start stringing down 
                and possibly ruin the print. I learned that overhangs are areas of the print that are not fully supported by the layer below it or by some sort of support that
                can be taken off after the print is done. It started off going the way I expected-with some hanging layers, but as the print went on, the layers became more stable and eventually the "failure" that can be 
                seen in the photo is all that really "messed up" the print.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 5 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Final product</h2>

            <img src="assets/GameBoyPrinted.jpg" alt="Yoshi Final Print">
            <p>
                Overall, I would say that the print was mostly successful, but there were some issues that I would consider stress points, such as the overhang under the nose and the adherence issues. I think this speaks to
                the limitations of the 3D printer and the design of the print. The printer relies on the design to have a good base fill in and support structure in order to print properly. I think that in the future, I would want 
                to fix the design flaws. The overhang can be prevented with a support structure, and only then would I consider the print to be a total success.
