            <h2>Hand without String</h2>
            <img src="assets/HandNoString.jpg" alt="3D printed hand prosthesis, no strings">
            <p>
                This was my hand prior to stringing the tensor pins. I found that the finger, knuckle, and 
                wrist pins worked out really well, despite having to reprint since the initial pins were quite frail. 
                I also purposefully kept the color palette while printing just cause I thought it looked cool and 
                were the only colors immediately available for printing. Overall, I was really happy with the outcome of the hand print 
                despite one major failure near the end.

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overhang and Print Issues</h2>
            <img src="assets/StringyPalm.jpg" alt="Overhang inside of palm">
            <p>
                The major failure was the palm of the hand. I had initially print the palm with supports, but the supports made the 
                machine print too fast and it ended up being a stringy and misaligned mess . This was what is called a layer shift. I had 
                to reprint the palm without supports and it came out much better despite there being some stringing. I was able to clean it 
                up with some pliers and sandpaper but it can still be a bit uncomfortable for the user since it needs filling where there is 
                a lack of filament.

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finished Hand with Tensioner Pins</h2>
            <img src="assets/FinishedHandTop.jpg" alt="3D printed hand prosthesis">
            <img src="assets/FinishedHandSide.jpg" alt="3D printed hand prosthesis">
            <p>
                This was the final hand with the tensioner pins. I found that the pins were a little too tight and had to sand them down a bit 
                to make them fit. After stringing the thumb I found it to be particularly tough to get the pins to stay inside the tensioner block 
                despite the screws being in place. I took the screws out and tested screwing them in outside of the block and despite being the largest 
                screw in the package, they would slide through as well. It was late at night and I didn't want to make noise going to find my toolbox outside 
                in the garage so I decided to leave it be. In class the next day, I realized that a lot of my classmates ran into the same issue which might 
                be due to the scale that the hand was printed at while the screws were meant for a smaller scale. Despite the issue, if I held the pins in place 
                where I wanted them, the hand was functional and able to move the fingers.

         <!-- Section 4 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Modification Idea</h2>
            <img src="assets/EnableModification.png" alt="Enable Hand Modification in Fusion">
            <p>
                Our modification idea was to add another thumb to the opposite side of the hand. This would allow for more functionality and hold various 
                objects instead of more cylindrical and/or uniform objects. This was really tough to do in fusion, so we decided it might be easiest to copy over the thumb 
                from the left handed prosthesis and mirror it to the other side to illustrate the modification we would make to the hand.
