        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hand without String</h2>
            <img src="assets/HandNoString.jpg" alt="Soldered Alarm Clock Back">
            <p>
                This was my hand prior to stringing the tensor pins. I found that the finger, knuckle, and 
                wrist pins worked out really well, despite having to reprint since the initial pins were quite frail. 
                I also purposefully kept the color palette while printing just cause I thought it looked cool and 
                were the only colors immediately available for printing. Overall, I was really happy with the outcome of the hand print 
                despite one major failure near the end.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overhang and Print Issues</h2>
            <img src="assets/StringyPalm.jpg" alt="3D Print Alarm clock design">
            <p>
                The major failure was the palm of the hand. I had initially print the palm with supports, but the supports made the 
                machine print too fast and it ended up being a stringy and misaligned mess . This was what is called a layer shift. I had 
                to reprint the palm without supports and it came out much better despite there being some stringing. I was able to clean it 
                up with some pliers and sandpaper but it can still be a bit uncomfortable for the user since it needs filling where there is 
                a lack of filament.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finished Hand with Tensioner Pins</h2>
            <img src="assets/FinishedHandTop.jpg" alt="3D printed alarm clock box">
            <p>
                The first 3D print was a success, but there were some intial stressing points since the allowance for the top and 
                bottom was very small, and the print was very thin. Luckily, I was able to little by little get the top and bottom 
                to fit together and not struggle to take them apart. The fit was also impeccable as the alarm clock fit perfectly in the box.
            </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Side-View of Hand</h2>
            <img src="assets/FinishedHandSide.jpg" alt="3D printed alarm clock box">
            <p>
               This was the 2nd 3D print including the holes for the button and charging cable. I found this print to be more functional 
               but maybe due to minute bed leveling deviations, this box was a little harder to put together and take apart.

         <!-- Section 5 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Modification Idea</h2>
            <img src="assets/HandModification" alt="Enable Hand Modification in Fusion">
            <p>
                Our modification idea was to add another thumb to the opposite side of the hand. This would allow for more functionality and hold various objects instead of more cylindrical objects.
