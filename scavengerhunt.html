        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for navigation without one or more of the 5 senses</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designfornavigation.jpg" alt="Soldered Alarm Clock Back">
            <p>
                We found that some of the classrooms have a little placard on the door that says the room number in braille. This was 
                designed to help people who are visually impaired navigate the science building, which can be especially dangerous with 
                all the corridors and stairs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for forms of assistance, broadly defined</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designforassitancebroad.jpg" alt="Designforassitancebroad">
            <p>
                The Gosman Gym elevator is a great example of a design for assistance. It helps people with mobility issues get to the 
                floor they need to get to and it's also spacious so it can fit a lot of people. It also helps for carrying large gym 
                equipment up and down the floors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for aging, broadly defined</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designforaging.jpg" alt="Designforaging">
            <p>
                My group found that the tiered display stands in the campus store are a great example of design for aging. The stands at 
                different heights allows for people of all ages to see the products on display. The stands are also on wheels so they can be 
                moved around easily.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for young children</h2>
            <img src="assets/DesignForChildren.jpg" alt="DesignForChildren">
            <p>
               The shade/light filters above the childrens playarea is a great example of design for young children. The shade protects the 
               children from the sun since they spend so much time outside. It is important to have adequate shade in childrens playgrounds 
               which is rare to see in other playgrounds.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 5 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for wheeled mobile gear</h2>
            <img src="assets/DesignForWheels.jpg" alt="DesignForWheels">
            <p>
                This ramp was recently installed near the front of campus to help people with mobility issues get up the hill. It used to be 
                just a regular hill with some worn down patches or flat areas for bikers but this way it made it accessible to more wheeled mobile gear.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 6 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design with physical barriers</h2>
            <img src="assets/DesignWithBarrier.jpg" alt="DesignWithBarrier">
            <p>
                Upon entering the SCC, there is an info booth but it was obstructed by a large display of balloons. This is an example of design with a barrier, 
                despite not intentional the placement of the balloons in the design of the event they were for is a physical barrier to the info booth.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 7 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design with a lack of information</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designwithlackofinfo.jpg" alt="Designwithlackofinfo">
            <p>
                Next to the SCC, there are stairs that lead to the lower level of the building. There is no sign that says where the stairs lead to or anything 
                preventing someone from going down there. There is a lack of information for anyone who is unfamiliar with the building or isn't explicitly told 
                to use those stairs/rooms.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 8 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design with an absence of help</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designwithabsenceofhelp.jpg" alt="Designwithabsenceofhelp">
            <p>
                Initially I thought the emergency buttons were an example of design for aging but upon further inspection, the buttons are not labeled with who or 
                what they call or do. Buttons such as this are also broken so despite being made for help, they are instead an absence of help.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 9 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for historical specificity</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designwithhistoricalspecificity.jpg" alt="Designwithhistoricalspecificity">
            <p>
                Majority of the freshman dorms are made of brick and have a very old look to them. This is an example of design for historical specificity. The 
                architects wanted all the buildings to look the same especially during a time when riots were common, thus many of the buildings are riot proof.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 10 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for environmental sustainability</h2>
            <img src="assets/DesignForSustainability.jpg" alt="DesignForSustainability">
            <p>
                The solor panels oon top of the stop signs are a great example of design for environmental sustainability. The solar panels power the stop signs 
                lights at night so that drivers can easily see them. This is a great way to save energy and reduce the carbon footprint of the campus while also 
                making it safer, especially at a busy and dangerous intersection.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 11 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for health and well-being</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designforhealth.jpg" alt="Designforhealth">
            <p>
                The gym being located next to main campus is a great example of design for health and well-being. The gym is easily accessible to all students 
                even from the large parking lot
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Section 12 -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Design for emergency access</h2>
            <img src="assets/Designforemergency.jpg" alt="Designforemergency">
            <p>
                The doors allowing firefighters to access the hydrant on the otherside of an enclosed ramp was quite brilliant. They didn't think they were going 
                to keep the temporary ramp there so they made a solution that would allow firefighters to access the hydrant without having to go around.
